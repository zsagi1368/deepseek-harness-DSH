/**
 * SessionTelemetryBackend Service Definition for the DeepSeek Harness.
 *
 * This package owns the CAPTURE side of session-event reporting — which records
 * exist (the chunk projection), what they carry (the logical record), when
 * they are captured (adoption, the per-append firehose, lifecycle
 * forwarding), live versus on-demand canonical-log capture, and the HMR
 * cursor. Everything downstream of
 * {@link SessionTelemetryBackend.emit} — batching, retry, queueing, and loss policy — is the
 * reporting SDK's territory and is deliberately not modelled here. The
 * design and its trade-offs are pinned in
 * .agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-07-23-session-telemetry-otel-revival.md.
 *
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-session-telemetry
