/**
 * Child-process entry for the Win32 folder dialog: blocks THIS process
 * inside the modal `Show` so the host event loop stays live, reporting over
 * the IPC channel. Spawned as a child process (not a worker thread) so the
 * dialog is the process's first window and Windows activates it without a
 * manual foreground call. Protocol: `{kind:'showing',threadId}` right
 * before the blocking call (the driver's abort lever needs the native
 * thread id), then exactly one of `{kind:'done',path}` or
 * `{kind:'error',message}`.
