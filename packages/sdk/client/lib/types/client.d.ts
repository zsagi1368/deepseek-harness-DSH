 * Low-level JSON-RPC client for a DeepSeek Harness SDK runtime subprocess.

 * the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-sdk-protocol` wire over the child's stdio, fans
 * server notifications out to subscriptions, and tears the child down to
 * quiescence through a private EOF → SIGTERM → SIGKILL ladder. The design
 * twin is the Python SDK's `HarnessClient` (`python/sdk`); both drive the
 * same runtime protocol. This client runs OUTSIDE any harness context, so it
 * spawns directly rather than through the `dsh-subprocess` service — the
