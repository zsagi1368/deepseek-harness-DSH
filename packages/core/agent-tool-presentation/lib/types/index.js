/**
 * Agent-plane presentation selector: the row an agent preset carries to say
 * which form of its tools the model sees.
 *
 * The tool registry itself stays on the host plane — the agent loop's
 * scheduler, the API proxy's presenters, and every tool plugin are all its
 * consumers, so it cannot move into a preset. What a preset CAN own is the
 * presentation: `ctx.tools.presentAs()` declares it for the mounting SCOPE,
 * which is the preset's standing mount, so the declaration covers every agent
 * joined to that preset and a Code Mode preset runs beside native ones in one
 * process. One row per composition, not one per session.
 *
 * A code mode needs a TypeScript code runtime, which is a host-plane service
 * ([`dsh-code-runtime-worker-thread`](../../code-runtime/code-runtime-worker/README.md)).
 * This row therefore waits for it rather than assuming it: a preset selecting
 * Code Mode against a deployment that composes no runtime fails at mount, named
 * in the preset's own activation audit, instead of at the first prompt.
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-tool-presentation
