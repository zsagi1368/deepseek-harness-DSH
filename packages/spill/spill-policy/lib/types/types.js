/**
 * Vocabulary for the spill-policy plugin: the minimal structural view of a tool
 * execution the policy needs to derive the owning session for a spill artifact.
 *
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools`' `ToolExecution` satisfies this shape, so the policy
 * reads `exec` straight through without importing `dsh-tools` or `dsh-agent`.
 * Only the session HEADER id is read — the same identity every other subsystem
 * keys off (see `dsh-tool-bash`'s owner derivation).
