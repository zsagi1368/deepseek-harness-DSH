/**
 * Commander adapter for the `dsh` command line.
 *
 * The launcher parses only what it owns — which profile to boot, which extra
 * patch overlays to apply, and the config dumps — and hands **everything after
 * its own flags** to the booted tree verbatim, where injected app plugins parse
 * their own flag families and print their own `--help` (see
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-cmdline`). Launcher flags therefore come first: the first
 * token this parser does not recognize starts the inner arguments, so
 * `dsh --profile tui --resume abc` boots the tui profile with `--resume abc`,
 * and `dsh --profile web -h` prints the web app's help, not this one's.
 *
 * `web` is a hardcoded alias for `--profile web`; `plugin` manages a profile's
 * plugin dependencies by forwarding to pnpm.
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh/args
